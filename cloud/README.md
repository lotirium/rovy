# Capstone Robot API

A FastAPI service that exposes discovery, telemetry, camera, and control endpoints for a Jetson-powered rover.

## Features

- Discovery endpoints (`/health`, `/network-info`) for mobile app connectivity checks.
- Camera endpoints for MJPEG streaming, single snapshots, and capture triggers.
- Status telemetry endpoint with sample sensor readings.
- Control endpoints for motion, stop, and camera head positioning.
- Connectivity endpoints for querying and initiating Wi-Fi connections.
- **🆕 AI Assistant with External Tools** - Weather, music, calculations, web search, and more!

## 🚀 New: AI Assistant Tools

The AI assistant now supports external API calls and tools! Ask about weather, control music, perform calculations, and more.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
python test_tools.py  # Test all available tools
```

**Available Tools (All FREE, No API Keys Needed!):**
- ☀️ Weather (Open-Meteo API) - Works immediately!
- 🕐 Time & Date - Works immediately!
- 🧮 Calculator - Works immediately!
- 🎵 Music Control - Optional (playerctl on Linux)

- ⏰ Reminders - Works immediately!

**Example Usage:**
Just ask naturally:
- "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
- "What time is it?"
- "Calculate 25 + 17"
- "Who is Albert Einstein?"

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Automatic tool detection
- ✅ Zero code changes needed
- ✅ Vision model separate (dual model preserved)
- ✅ Fast response (tools return directly)
- ✅ No API keys required
- ✅ Graceful fallback to LLM

## Getting Started

### Hardware Setup (OAK-D Camera)

If you're using an OAK-D camera, you need to set up udev rules to allow non-root access to the device:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-oakd-udev.sh
```

This only needs to be done once per system. After running this script, you may need to unplug and replug the OAK-D device.

### Installation

Use the provided setup script to create a virtual environment and install the API along with its development dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Running the API

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

By default, the service will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or `http://192.168.4.1:8000` when running on the robot hotspot).

#### Quick OAK-D streaming endpoints

For a lightweight MJPEG stream similar to a standard webcam feed, the main API now exposes convenience routes at `/video` and `/shot` in addition to the existing `/camera/*` endpoints. These reuse the same camera service configuration, so they automatically pick the DepthAI pipeline when available and fall back to USB webcams or the placeholder frames when necessary.

#### Forcing USB webcam mode

If you only need MJPEG streaming from a USB camera (including the OAK-D operating in UVC mode) set the following environment variables in your shell or systemd unit before starting the service:

```bash
export CAMERA_FORCE_WEBCAM=1          # Skip DepthAI initialisation entirely
export CAMERA_WEBCAM_DEVICE=/dev/video2  # Optional: explicit device path or index
```

When `CAMERA_FORCE_WEBCAM` is enabled the API ignores the DepthAI SDK and opens the camera just like a standard webcam via OpenCV. When no device override is provided the service scans `/dev/v4l/by-id` for entries containing `oak`, `depthai`, or `luxonis` so an attached OAK-D Lite in UVC mode is automatically preferred before falling back to generic `/dev/video*` indices.

#### Configuring the rover controller serial port

The claim flow will display the generated PIN on the rover's OLED screen when a compatible microcontroller is connected over UART. The service automatically scans common device paths (including entries reported by `serial.tools.list_ports`), but you can explicitly point it at a known serial device using the `ROVER_SERIAL_DEVICE` environment variable:

```bash
export ROVER_SERIAL_DEVICE=/dev/ttyTHS1
```

On startup the API validates that the device exists and is accessible. The path is also retried lazily the first time the `/claim/request` endpoint is hit, so you can plug the controller in after the service is running.

To launch the service automatically on your Jetson at boot, install the provided systemd unit from `scripts/api.service`:

1. Copy the repository to the target location (for example `/home/jetson/rovy/api`).
2. Adjust the `User`, `WorkingDirectory`, and optional `Environment=` lines in `scripts/api.service` to match your setup.
3. Install the unit and enable it:

   ```bash
   sudo cp scripts/api.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now api.service
   ```

You can confirm it started successfully with `systemctl status api.service` and inspect logs via `journalctl -u api.service`.

### Checking logs

The robot API is designed to run under systemd, so the easiest way to review logs is with `journalctl`:

```bash
# Show the most recent messages and keep following new ones
sudo journalctl -u api.service -f

# Review logs from the current boot only
sudo journalctl -u api.service --since "today"
```

If you launched the server manually (for example while developing on a workstation), logs are written to the console. You can stream them with any log follower, such as:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 2>&1 | tee uvicorn.log
tail -f uvicorn.log
```

For more verbose diagnostics, adjust the log level before starting the service:

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
sudo systemctl restart api.service
```

This uses the `scripts/logging.ini` configuration that ships with the project, so any changes you make there will automatically be reflected in both the systemd unit and manual runs.

### Updating a running deployment

Once the service is installed and enabled you can deploy new versions with the following workflow:

1. Copy the updated repository (or run `git pull`) on the Jetson.
2. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` if you introduced new dependencies.
3. Restart the service to pick up the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart api.service
   ```

`scripts/autorun.sh` honours the `LOG_LEVEL` and `LOG_CONFIG` environment variables if you need to adjust logging for troubleshooting. The defaults enable the packaged `scripts/logging.ini`, which surfaces INFO-level camera diagnostics in `journalctl`.

### Testing

Run the automated tests with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

## Endpoints Overview

- `GET /health` – returns robot connectivity and firmware metadata.
- `GET /network-info` – exposes current network IP/SSID information.
- `GET /camera/snapshot` – serves an inline JPEG snapshot from the live camera when available, otherwise the placeholder image.
- `GET /camera/stream` – provides an MJPEG stream sourced from the DepthAI camera when present, falling back to the placeholder frames.
- `POST /camera/capture` – simulates capturing a photo and returning saved metadata.
- `GET /status` – reports mock telemetry, battery, and AI state data.
- `POST /control/move` – echoes requested linear/angular velocities.
- `POST /control/stop` – confirms a stop command.
- `POST /control/head` – echoes requested pan/tilt angles.
- `GET /mode` – reports the current connectivity mode.
- `POST /wifi/connect` – simulates initiating a Wi-Fi connection.

## Development Notes

- Camera endpoints automatically prefer an attached OAK-D/DepthAI device unless `CAMERA_FORCE_WEBCAM=1` is set. In webcam mode the service captures frames from the specified USB device (default `0`) using OpenCV.
- Update the data returned by telemetry and discovery endpoints to reflect real robot values as sensors and subsystems come online.
