Overview: For this Capstone Design course, you will create a series of hands-on video lectures
instead of a traditional written project report. Each video should combine theory and practice:
explain key concepts, then demonstrate them step-by-step (for example, writing and running
code or operating hardware such as robots or Arduino boards). The goal is to produce polished
tutorial videos that cover your project in detail. These videos will be used as learning materials
for future students.
Video Format and Length: Each video should be edited for clarity and be under 1 hour long.
Break up longer topics into multiple videos so no single video is too long. In fact, educational
research suggests that student attention drops sharply after about 15 minutes[1], so keep
individual segments concise and focused. Use clear screen recordings (e.g. of your code editor,
slides, or robot interface) and good audio. Avoid simply filming a live presentation with a fixed
camera – this often leads to poor audio and unreadable visuals[2]. Instead, use screen-capture
or recording software so that code, slides, and demonstrations are clearly visible.
Note: The quality of microphone is very important!
Content Structure: Each video should include the following components: - Introduction: State
what the video will cover and its objectives. - Theoretical Background: Briefly explain the key
theory or concepts before the demo. Use diagrams or slides if helpful. - Hands-On
Demonstration: Show step-by-step how to implement the project tasks. For example, type out
and explain the code line by line, configure hardware, run tests on the robot, etc. Narrate each
action clearly. Highlight important details or common pitfalls as you go. - Summary: Conclude
with the main takeaways and any next steps.
Strive for a narrative flow: explain why you are doing each step, not just how. Use examples and
commentary to make the content clear and engaging.
Supporting Materials: Along with each video, submit all related files in well-organized folders.
This should include: - Source Code: All code files shown or used in the video. - Documentation:
Any text (e.g. brief README, comments, schematic diagrams) needed to understand the
project. You may include text summaries or bullet points, but a formal written report is not
required. - Additional Resources: Slides, images, datasets, or any other materials referenced in
the video.
Label your folders and files clearly so another student can easily find the code corresponding to
each video segment. These materials will accompany the videos on the class platform.
Submission and Distribution:
- Private Submission: Do not upload your videos to public websites. First submit the final edited
videos and files to the designated folder at Sejong University eCampus or designated dropbox
for review.
- Class Platform Only: After approval, the videos will be uploaded to our secure eCampus site
for student use. They should not be posted on YouTube or any public site.
- Ensure you meet any technical requirements (format, resolution) specified by the class.
Sample Tutorials: We encourage you to review example tutorial videos to guide your approach.
For instance, look for high-quality video-based tutorials on topics similar to your project
(robotics demos, programming walkthroughs, etc.). These can serve as inspiration for how to
structure your presentation. If sample project files or code templates are provided by the
instructor, use them as a starting point. Understanding how others present tutorials will help
you create engaging content.
Grading and Evaluation: You will receive a detailed rubric outlining the grading criteria. In
general, your videos and materials will be evaluated on: - Technical Accuracy (content):
Correctness and completeness of the theory and implementation demonstrated.
- Clarity of Presentation: How clearly you explain concepts and steps (logical flow, pacing, and
explanations).
- Code Quality and Documentation: Functionality of your code and usefulness of any
accompanying comments or docs.
- Production Quality: Audio/visual quality of the video (clear visuals of code/hardware,
understandable audio, smooth editing).
- Engagement (hands-on exercise): Effectiveness of the hands-on demonstrations and any
included exercises.
For example, the rubric might allocate points roughly as follows: 30% for technical content, 30%
for code/demo quality, 20% for presentation clarity, and 20% for video production and
organization. Make sure your videos meet the objectives stated and that all required
components are covered, as per the rubric provided.
Best Practices:
- Plan Carefully: Outline or script your video before recording. Practice key parts to avoid long
pauses or mistakes.
- Keep It Engaging: Speak clearly, use visuals (slides, live coding windows, schematics), and
consider picture-in-picture if it helps (e.g. showing yourself explaining slides).
- Use Good Audio: Record in a quiet environment with a decent microphone so your voice is
clear.
- Edit Thoughtfully: Remove long delays or errors in editing. Add annotations or zoom-ins if it
clarifies the code/hardware.
- Active Learning: Where possible, include small tasks or questions at the end of each video to
reinforce learning (research suggests this boosts engagement[3]).
- Manage Length: Keep each tutorial focused. If a topic takes longer, break it into shorter parts
so students stay attentive[1].
- Practice Professionalism: Treat the video as a real presentation. Dress appropriately, maintain
good posture, and engage as if you are teaching the material.
By following these guidelines, you will create a series of clear, useful tutorial videos for your
Capstone project. These videos and materials will serve as the primary project deliverables and
learning resources for future students. Ensure you cover all project requirements in a hands-on,
step-by-step manner, and adhere to the specified format and submission rules. Good luck with
your Capstone project!
